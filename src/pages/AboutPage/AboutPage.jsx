            be successfull regarless ups and downs of the market. That's

            who aim to have disciplined and committed investment approach, by
            investing equal amount of money at regular intervals. It allows them

          <h2 className="about__subtitle">Definition</h2>
          <p className="about__quote">
            "Dollar-cost averaging involves investing the same amount of money
            in a target security at regular intervals over a certain period of
            time, regardless of price. By using dollar-cost averaging, investors

            Dollar-Cost Averaging vs. Timing the Market
          </h2>

            Alternatively to DCA, another approach by investors, and a common
            fallacy from outsiders of the unique successful strategy, is Time
            the Market. It requires long hours of dedicatoin over exetensive
            analisys and close market monitoring and most of time can be
            impossible to predict the next low. To illustrate, the chart below
            demonstrate an overall return following both strategies betwwen
            1975-2014:

            Although, buying the dip of the market outperforms DCA, there are
            periods where DCA follows closely the same trend and over time
            there's minimal gap in the final gains.
